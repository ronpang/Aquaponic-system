Monitoring the values of the aquaponic and controls the fishing pump

## Monitoring
There are few important values required to monitor.

1. PH values
2. ORP values
3. Temperature

## PH value
PH values related to the ratio between the ammonia(NH3) to ammonium (NH4+)

1. When PH increased, the amount of ammonia will increase and ammonium will decrease
2. When PH decreased, the amount of ammonia will decrease and ammonium will increase

Ammonia is created from fishes wasted and the food remains inside the fishing tanks. Ammonia is a toxic component to the fishes, therefore it is important for removing these toxic materials from the fish tank.

Ammonia in water will quickly picks up a proton and transform to ammonium that is not harmful to the fish. Ammonium could be apsorb and used by plants, therefore increasing the the numbers of ammonium would be helpful for making the water turn clean by plants. 

According to my research, PH value within 6.8 - 7 is the bast value for the fish and the plants.

## ORP value
ORP values is calculating the oxidizer agents and reducing agents

ORP values is calucating in millivolts (mv). 

1. When there are a lot of oxidizer, it wanted to absorbed more electrons. Therefore it creates a positive voltage
2. When there are a lot of reducing agents, it creates a lot of electrons for oxidizer. This creates a negative voltage

By using ammonium as the only method to remove the ammonia from the fish tank, it will not be a enough to remove most of the ammonia.

Using bacteria to extra method to create more foods for the plant and reduce the ammonia is the best way to solve this issue. 

There are bacterias could covert ammonia into nitrates. Nitrates are the best food source for plant growth. 

Howevever, nitrates are still toxic to fish. Thus, it is important to remove these toxic materials from the fish tank.

1. Ammonium  = oxidizer agent
2. Nitrates  = reducing agent

According to my research, having a positive voltage results means there would be a highly chance to have more food inside the fish tank.

Suggested OPR value is 350mV - 450mV
